  * Today’s students live in a world characterized by a growing diversity and richness of social differences. In the seventh edition of Social Statistics for a Diverse Society, authors Chava Frankfort-Nachmias and Anna Leon-Guerrero continue to help students learn statistics through real research examples related to the dynamic interplay of race, class, gender, and other social variables. Focusing on the constant intersections between local and global social concerns and methods of inquiry and investigation, this new edition continues to emphasize intuition and common sense while demonstrating the link between the practice of statistics and important social issues. In addition, guides for reading and interpreting the research literature help students understand key statistical concepts, while SPSS demonstrations and a rich variety of exercises help them hone their problem-solving skills.
